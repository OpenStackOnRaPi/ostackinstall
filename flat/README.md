# Extendable setup with a flat provider network

This folder contains network configuration files for the basic setup of OpenStack with a flat provider network used to be used also as external network.

This setup can later be modified (extended) to enable VLAN provider networks using updated/new files contained in directory [vlanned](../vlanned).
